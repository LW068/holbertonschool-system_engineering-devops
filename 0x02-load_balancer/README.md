# 0x02-load_balancer

## Description:

In this project, I worked on setting up a load balancer to enhance the redundancy and reliability of my web stack. By doubling up on the web servers and putting them behind a load balancer, I made sure the infrastructure can handle increased traffic and stay up and running, even if one of the servers goes down. I created Bash scripts to automate configuring new Ubuntu servers, making sure that Nginx includes a custom HTTP header to track which web server is responding to HTTP requests.
