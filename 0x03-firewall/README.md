## Description:

A firewall is a crucial security system that monitors and controls network traffic to protect devices and data from potential threats. It comes in two main types: network-based firewalls, which protect an entire network, and host-based firewalls, which run on individual devices. The primary function of a firewall is to filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules, blocking unauthorized access and preventing cyberattacks.
