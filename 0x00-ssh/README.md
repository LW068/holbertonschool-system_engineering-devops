# 0x00-ssh

## Description:

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to remote servers over a network. It allows users to remotely access and manage a server through an encrypted connection, providing a secure alternative to traditional remote login methods such as Telnet or FTP. To use SSH, users must create an SSH key pair consisting of a public and private key, and then add the public key to the remote server's authorized keys file. This allows users to connect to the server without having to enter a password. SSH also provides additional security features such as encrypted data transfer, secure file transfer, and the ability to create secure tunnels for other network services.
