# 0x04-mysql

## Description:

In this SQL project, I will explore the fundamental concepts of database management, including the main role of a database, database replication, and the purpose of a database replica. I will also learn why database backups need to be stored in different physical locations and understand the operations that should be regularly performed to ensure a robust database backup strategy. By completing this project, I will be able to explain these concepts without the help of external resources and apply these principles in real-world scenarios.
