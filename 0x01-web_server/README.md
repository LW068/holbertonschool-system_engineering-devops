# 0x01-web_server

## Description:

This project covers essential concepts related to web servers and the Domain Name System (DNS). We explore the primary function of web servers, which is to serve static or dynamic content in response to user requests, and their architecture involving parent and child processes to manage connections and efficiently distribute workloads. The project also delves into the workings of DNS, a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, facilitating user access to websites using domain names rather than numeric IPs. Additionally, we examine various DNS record types (A, CNAME, TXT, and MX) that serve different purposes in managing domain configurations and associated services.
